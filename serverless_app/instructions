1- DynamoDB
creating a table named : devops-raffle which partition key is email(string)
table properties: class is DynamoDB Standard-IA
                  capacity_mode is on-demand
.................................................................................................................
2- lambda functions 
we will have 3 functions for (apply_raffle,count_raffle,draw_raffle) but first we will create an IAM role which will used 
by this fuctions named raffle-role and has (AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess,AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole,AWSLambdaInvocation-DynamoDB,CloudWatchLogsFullAccess)
policies 
the code of this functions is in .js files

Once testing this functions that will affect on the devops-raffle table
.................................................................................................................
3- Api Getway
    a- creating domain name (in my case i don't have an aws one instead of it i have a GoDaddy one named ata-devops.online
    to use it in aws i have created a hostedZone with the same name but i took the name servers in NS record and pate it 
    in GoDaddy namesrves  see Domain pictures)
    b- create ACM certificate :
            Fully qualified domain name : api.ata-devops.online
            Validation method: DNS validation
            Key algorithm: RSA 2048
        after creating it in Domains Create records in Route 53 that will validate you are the author of that domain
    c- creatin the api GW:
        1-  type: http
            name: raffle
            stage_name: dev
        2- after creating in Custom domain names put the domain name which you generate certificate to it "api.ata-devops.online"
           and then choose ACM certificate that you did "as in the pics"
        3- api_mapping: as in the pic 
        4- creatin record in hostedzone for this GW to link the domain with the gw endpoint as in pics
    d- connecting the lambda functions with the api gw attach all routes with it's functions
.................................................................................................................
4- a- enabling mutual tls authentication for api Getway : download OppenSSl from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html "Win64 OpenSSL v3.3.1 Light
EXE "  and then install it then follow instructions with https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-mutual-tls-authentication-for-amazon-api-gateway/
   b- creating a s3 bucket named "devops90-ca-api-getway" and put "RootCA.pem" in it
      then take S3 URI "s3://devops90-ca-api-getway/RootCA.pem" and in api-gw "Custom domain names" put it in "Mutual TLS authentication"
      as pics
  c- in cli : openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey my_client.key -in my_client.pem -out my_client.p12"this will import the certificates in the browser"
.................................................................................................................
5- hosting html pages on s3"don't allow https" and cloudfront
   a- s3: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html
   b- cloudfront: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started-cloudfront-overview.html
   See CROS pics
   c- creatin ACM certificate for cloudfront without subdomain
   d- create cloudfront as pics
   e- make a record to it in the hostedzone and the alias to cloudfront
